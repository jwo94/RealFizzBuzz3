Step 3:
Enhance your existing solution to perform the following:
1. Produce a report at the end of the program showing how many times the following were
output:
a. Fizz
b. Buzz
c. Fizzbuzz
d. Lucky

e. an integer

e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output:
1. 1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
fizz: 4
buzz: 3
fizzbuzz: 1
lucky: 2
integer: 10
(Integer is 10 because there were 10 numbers that were not altered in any way).
